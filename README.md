# DSA2040A_DataMining_-Group_3-
A data mining project, applying ETL, analysis and visualization on the data.

# Health Data Mining Group Project

## Project Title
Mining Patterns in Patient Health Records for Better Preventive Care. 
This project focuses on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) health data to uncover insights that can lead to improved patient outcomes.

##  Project Goals
1. **ETL Process**: Extract and transform synthetic health data to prepare it for analysis.
2. **Data Mining**: Apply data mining techniques to discover patterns in patient health records.
3. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to effectively communicate findings.        
4. **Documentation**: Document the entire process, including challenges faced and solutions implemented.

## Documentation
- **README.md**: Overview of the project, goals, and structure.
- **Final Report**: Detailed documentation of the ETL process, data mining techniques used, and findings.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for ETL, analysis, and visualization.
- **Source Code**: Python scripts for ETL, analysis, and visualization tasks.  

## Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive understanding of the ETL process applied to health data.
- Identification of key patterns in patient health records.
- Visualizations that highlight significant findings.
- A final report summarizing the project, methodologies, and insights gained.

## 🏥 Project Topic: Health

We aim to analyze patient health records to identify patterns in chronic conditions, lifestyle risks, and hospital readmissions. The goal is to use ETL + Data Mining techniques to provide insights that can improve preventive care.

## 📊 Data Description

We'll generate a synthetic health dataset containing:
- Demographics: Age, gender
- Lifestyle factors: Smoking status, activity level
- Clinical metrics: BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol
- Medical outcomes: Diagnosis, hospital stay, readmission
